## Notes

1. **Requirements File**: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python dependencies.
2. **Server Script**: The command `python server.py` assumes your server script is named `server.py`. Adjust if your script name differs.
3. **Socket.IO**: Adjust the installation steps if using a specific version of `socket.io`.
